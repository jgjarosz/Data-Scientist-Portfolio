# Data-Scientist-Portfolio

Samples of my analyses that demonstrate different skillsets such as EDA, hypothesis testing, data visualization, and machine learning model construction & evaluation. These projects are not intended to be exhaustive end-to-end analyses, but to be sufficient to showcase my skill levels with both Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning model creation/tuning/evaluation.



RAMEN RATINGS

- Description: This dataset contains 2580 records of ramen ratings. It has features of Brand, Country, and Style,, with an output of a Stars (1-5 stars) rating. Follow the Kaggle link for more details.

- Skills demonstrated: data manipulation with Pandas, EDA, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, normality assessment, hypothesis testing, and algorithmic thinking (see the section on Wilcoxon Rank-Sum for a performance-optimized pair-generating algorithm).



HEART DISEASE UCI

- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

- Description: This dataset contains 303 patient records and 13 features with a target column of whether or not they have heart disease. It is a binary classification problem, so I used it to build a logistic regression classifier, tune it, and evaluate it.

- Skills demonstrated: Machine learning model building with Scikit-Learn, model tuning & evaluation using a variety of Scikit-Learn submodules, data visualization
